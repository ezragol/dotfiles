## dotfiles for my hyprland/eww setup
very simple, but mostly functional and usable for everyday stuff. most topbar elements also have tooltips (not pictured). includes:
- working volume buttons
- working mute/unmute button (virtual also, in topbar)
- working brightness buttons (intel)
- working spotify info in topbar
- autojump to window for chrome, spotify, vscode
- fully functional topbar
- wifi info
- working hyprlock config (not pictured)
- mini sliding menus in topbar

I use this setup on arch for my school laptop and it works perfectly fine for most things. the audio setup is very questionable and the camera does not work. this project is shockingly time consuming and also slightly frustrating.

more stuff to come eventually. this project is a work in progress that I only touch when I am not busy with school/work (which is rarely)
